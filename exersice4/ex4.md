#Exercise 4 Double particle decay
##problem 1.5
Consider again a decay problem with two types of nuclei A and B, but now suppose that nuclei of typw A decay into type B, while nuclei of type B decay into type A. Strictly speaking, this is not a "decay" process, since it is possible for the type B nuclei to turn back into type A. A better analogy would be a resonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between two states A and B which have equal energies. The corresponding rate equations are ï¼Œ<br>

where for simplicity we have assumed that the two types of decay are characterized by the same time constant ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%7B%5Ctau%20%7D). Solve the system of equations for the numbers of nuclei, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7BA%7D) and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7BB%7D), as functions of time. Consider different initial confitions, such as ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7BA%7D%3D100), ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7BB%7D%3D0), etc., and take ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ctau%20%3D1) s. Show that your numerical results are consistent with the idea that the system reaches a steady state in which ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7BA%7D) and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_%7BB%7D) are constant. In such a steady state, the time derivatives ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20N_%7BA%7D%7D/%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20t%7D) and ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20N_%7BB%7D%7D/%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%20t%7D) should vanish.

##Abstract
  This is my first time using python to solve the easy Physics problem.And in the class,we have known that the easist situation of one particle decay.From the teacher's ppt , there is a standard python code about the decay,and describe a decay by using "class".So i try
to use the same method to describe the double partical problem,and plot the picture.
